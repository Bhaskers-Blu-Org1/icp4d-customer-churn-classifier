The notbooks refer to Brunel CSS files that come with ICP for Data.
The fix_example.sh will tweak these examples to use CSS hosted by
brunelvis.org so that these interactive examples can be used on
public github.

The script outputs fixed.ipynb instead of clobbering the source
notebook. So you are on your own to diff, copy, commit, push...
enjoy.
